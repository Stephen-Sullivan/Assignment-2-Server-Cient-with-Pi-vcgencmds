## Raspberry Pi System Information Server

This project includes a server script that runs on a Raspberry Pi, collecting various system metrics using the `vcgencmd` command. It then sends this information to a client upon request. The system metrics include the core temperature, core voltage, ARM CPU clock speed, and HDMI clock speed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need a Raspberry Pi set up with the necessary software to run `vcgencmd` commands.

### Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS or similar.
- Python 3 installed on the Raspberry Pi.
- The `vcgencmd` utility, typically pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS.
